# Seismometer

Most public administrations publish who runs which parts of their structure online. Some publish an opendata file to record who is who and they update it regularly. The autonomous government of Catalonia published such a file here http://dadesobertes.gencat.cat/ca/cercador/cerca-cataleg?q=organismes and MV created the seismograph https://github.com/mvtango/generalitat, a tool to monitor changes by comparing today's file to yesterday's file everyday. Daily changes were published here http://opengov.cat/sismograf and there is an API too http://opengov.cat/en/2014/07/how-to-contribute-to-the-seismograph-jpd14/. About two years later, the file is no longer published, so PG is creating a similar file from scratch for the seismograph to continue working.
